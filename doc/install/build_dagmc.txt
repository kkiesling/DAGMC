Build |DAG-Code|
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Use Make to install |DAG-Code|.
::

    $ make
    $ make install

If the build was successful, the binaries, libraries, header files, and tests
will be installed to the ``bin``, ``lib``, ``include``, and ``tests``
subdirectories of ``$INSTALL_PATH`` respectively.

In order to use DAGMC, make these additions to your paths:
::

    $ export PATH=$PATH:$INSTALL_PATH/bin
    $ export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:$INSTALL_PATH/lib

Again, it may be wise to add these commands to your ``.bashrc`` file.
