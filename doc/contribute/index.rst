==========

DAGMC is an Open Source BSD3 licensed project, open for anyone to fork, make personal changes,
or contribute changes back to us. DAGMC exists in the open so that anyone can make meaningful 
contributions to DAGMC development, it is our belief that by having user contributions and 
development makes DAGMC better software for everyone.

If you want to contribute to DAGMC it would be useful to read the `Contributors Guide <contributeguide.html>`_ so
that your contributions match the style guide and your workflow matches the philosophy of the project. We try hard to
test everything before release and have testing that runs daily, however bugs sometimes occur we 
would appreciate if when you find a bug, you report it on the 
`github site <https://github.com/svalinn/DAGMC/issues>`_.
